Hiperisland school project
Mission :
use react and create an application using a public API

Process:
I used the New York Times public API and implemented a simple layout listing  and filtering news by keyword.


Struggles: 
-understanding controlled inputs and keeping track of my props.
-fixing my app when it crashed , as I later found out because some of the data fields were left empty in my API response, I fixed issue with some terneray conditionals.

Next on the menu: redesign UI to add more sections and categories, add pagination to main content , sidesection with categories, individual news page, and footer.
