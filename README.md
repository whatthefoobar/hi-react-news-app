React news app project using New York Times Api
Hiperisland school project Mission : use react and create an application using a public API

Process: I used the New York Times public API and implemented a simple layout listing and filtering news by keyword.

Struggles: -understanding controlled inputs and keeping track of my props. -fixing my app when it crashed , as I later found out because some of the data fields were left empty in my API response, I fixed issue with some terneray conditionals.

Next on the menu: redesign UI to add more sections and categories, add pagination to main content , sidesection with categories, individual news page, and footer.
